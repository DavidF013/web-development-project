    My name is David Fatoki, and I was born on April 22, 2005
    in Riverdale, Georgia. My parents migrated from Nigeria to the United States. And I've learned so much about my Nigerian heritage and culture. At first when I entered college, I was a computer science major. But after realizing that I'm not that passionate about the topic I chose something similar with IT and I was a lot more familiar with It in high school.  So, I decided to change my major to an IT major and I'm pretty satisfied with it currently. 
    I'm a pretty calm and creative person. I'm also kind of quiet and I love learning new things. Especially if it deals with technology. In my free time I usually play video games or do some cooking and baking. I do also like reading articles about things going on in the tech and sports industries and just doing research on different things. To me, life is best when you're learning something new, and I strive to learn new things every day.

    In terms of experience, I have delt with many things regarding technology. I completed two pathways in high school for Information technology and Accounting. I ended up choosing to get an accounting certificate, since I did find that more appealing at the time. The closest thing to work experience that I’ve experienced is at my church. I've been in the electronics/media team department for over 7 years managing all the recordings, audio, cameras, and projectors. 
    I am in the electronics section in my church. In school, I have always been an honor roll student with A's and B’s, and I ended up with a 3.6 GPA in high school. In high school is when I also started to learn programming. And I learned how to code in python and Java very well. To me, programing was a way to experiment with my creativity and I had fun doing it. But in college I realized that I'm not that passionate about it and it was a big factor in my major change from Computer Science to Information Technology.

In terms of goals, career wise I want to have a job in the cybersecurity or the IT field. Most likely something that deals with analytics since I love analyzing different problems trying to find a solution or result.
Another goal of mine is to learn and invest in the stock market. My family has mentioned it to me and I do find the stock market a great way to make money. Another big aspiration of mine is to start my own tech company that will be mainly software based. 
I want to make a big effect in technology and I think that owning a tech business that is a great way to start. People such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Jensen Hung had big ideas, and their respective companies are examples 
of their ideas. I hope to make a footprint on the tech industry and want to innovate and learn more about the capabilities of tech as a whole.
